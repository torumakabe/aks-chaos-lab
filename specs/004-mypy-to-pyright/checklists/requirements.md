# Specification Quality Checklist: 型チェッカーをmypyからpyrightへ移行

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2024-12-24  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
